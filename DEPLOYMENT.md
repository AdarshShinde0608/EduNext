# EduNext Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Your project is now ready for Vercel deployment!

### What I've prepared for you:

1. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Configured for proper build and routing
2. **Added CORS support** - API routes now handle cross-origin requests
3. **Created `.vercelignore`** - Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
4. **Added build scripts** - Ready for Vercel's build process
5. **Tested build locally** - Confirmed everything works

### 📋 Deployment Steps:

#### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from your project root
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (choose your account)
# - Link to existing project? N
# - Project name: edunext (or your preferred name)
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? N
```

#### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the settings from `vercel.json`

### 🔐 Environment Variables Setup:

After deployment, you need to set up environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add the following variable:
   - **Name**: `JWT_SECRET`
   - **Value**: Generate a secure random string (e.g., use `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

### 🧪 Testing Your Deployment:

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health` - Should return server status
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test` - Should return "API is working!"
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` - Should show your React app

### 📁 Project Structure:
```
├── edunext/                 # Frontend React app
│   ├── src/                # React source code
│   ├── api/                # Serverless API functions
│   │   └── [...route].js   # Main API handler
│   ├── dist/               # Built frontend (generated)
│   └── package.json        # Frontend dependencies
├── vercel.json             # Vercel configuration
├── .vercelignore           # Files to exclude from deployment
└── backend/                # Not deployed (local development only)
```

### 🔧 Key Features:
- ✅ React frontend with Vite
- ✅ Serverless API functions
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ CORS enabled
- ✅ User registration/login
- ✅ In-memory data storage (for demo)

### 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Data Storage**: Currently using in-memory storage. Data will reset on each serverless function restart. For production, consider using a database like Vercel Postgres, MongoDB Atlas, or Supabase.

2. **JWT Secret**: Make sure to set a secure `JWT_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel.

3. **Custom Domain**: You can add a custom domain in Vercel project settings.

4. **Monitoring**: Check Vercel's function logs for any issues.

### 🆘 Troubleshooting:

- **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are in `edunext/package.json`
- **API not working**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
- **CORS issues**: The API now includes proper CORS headers
- **404 errors**: Check that routes in `vercel.json` match your API structure

### 🎉 You're all set!

Your EduNext application is now ready for production deployment on Vercel!
